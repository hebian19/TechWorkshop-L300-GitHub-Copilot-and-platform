# Task 01 - Create an infrastructure Issue in GitHub 

## Description

During this task you will create a GitHub issue using Chat with Copilot. This issue will be later used to generate a Bicep script to produce the necessary Azure resources for next steps in this lab.

## Success Criteria

- You have generated an issue in GitHub

## Learning Resources

## Key Tasks

### 01: Open Chat with Copilot

Navigate to your forked repository for this lab at GitHub and select Chat with Copilot from the top menu:

Confirm that you have the correct repository context. If you started from the repository from Chat, you should see it selected:

### 02: Create the issue

You will prompt to create the GitHub issue that describes the following infrastructure requirements: 
- Deploying the ZavaStorefront web application in a Docker container to a Linux-based app service
- You will need an Azure Container Registry for the container
- You will ask for Application Insights to be enabled, and choose a region (such as West US 3)

From Chat with Copilot enter the following prompt to create an issue: 

```bash
/create-issue Provision Azure infrastructure for the ZavaStorefront web application. It will need a Linux App Service, and I want to use Docker to deploy to the App Service, so I'll need a Container Registry as well. But I don't want to install docker on my local machine. The AppService should use Azure RBAC to pull images not passwords. I want to monitor it with Application Insights. I will be using GPT-4 and Phi so I will need Azure AI Foundry, I want to use westus3 because they are available there. Everything should be deployed together in one resource group in the same region. This is a dev environment and I want to use AZD with Bicep to define and deploy everything.
```
The end result should be that GitHub Copilot creates an issue that looks similar to the following:
